This repository contains MATLAB code that implements a computational model of retinal ganglion cell processing, designed to reproduce the unique homogeneity preference observed in Off-transient (OffT) alpha retinal ganglion cells (αRGCs). The model is motivated by experimental findings showing that, under mesopic conditions, OffT αRGCs preferentially respond to spatially uniform stimuli—even when such stimuli lack the fine spatial details to which most retinal ganglion cells are normally sensitive.
